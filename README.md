# Chatbot-using-Deep-Learning
Chatbots are simulations which can understand human language, process it and interact back with humans while performing specific tasks.  For example, a chatbot can be employed as a helpdesk executive.  The first chatbot was created by Joseph Wiesenbaum in 1966, named Eliza.  These advancements have led us to an era where conversations with chatbots have become as normal and natural as with another human. Today, almost all companies have chatbots to engage their users and serve customers by catering to their queries.  Chatbots will be handling 85% of the customer service interactions by the year 2021.
